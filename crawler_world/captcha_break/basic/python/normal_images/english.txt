+ spider ( spider object) - the spider which has been closed

+ reason (str) - a string which describes the reason why the spider was closed. If it
was closed because the spider has completed scraping, the reason is ‘finished’ .
Otherwise, if the spider was manually closed by calling the close_spider engine
method, then the reason is the one passed in the reason argument of that
method (which defaults to ‘cancelled’ ). If the engine was shutdown (for

example, by hitting Ctrl-C to stop it) the reason will be ‘shutdown’ .
